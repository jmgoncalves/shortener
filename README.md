# URL Shortener

Create short URLs with this (minimal) piece of work! It comprises of a Redis database, Scala-based backend, static React frontend and an nginx proxy to wrap everything together and avoid CORS fun.

Just clone the repository and `docker-compose up` and after an eternity downloading dependencies and building everything you can access the UI @ http://localhost:8080/ui/

Short links start with http://localhost:8080/l/ and the API is accessible from http://localhost:8080/api

Enjoy!
